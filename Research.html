							<h2><strong>What is the problem</strong></h2>
							<p class="major">Despite growing investment in artificial intelligence, organisations are still deploying AI blindly without the strategic capabilities needed to translate data, algorithms, and digital tools into meaningful environmental or operational gains. As a result, agri-food supply chains continue to face systemic sustainability challenges, including resource inefficiency, emissions, waste, and vulnerability to shocks. What is missing is not the technology itself, but a clear understanding of which AI capabilities matter, how they create sustainable value, and why organisations fail to integrate them strategically leaving the sector technologically advanced yet strategically underpowered.</a>.</p>

							<h2><strong>Research Abstract</strong></h2>
							<p>To address climate change, resource limitations, and evolving consumer preferences, there must be a shift from practices focused solely on efficiency to those prioritising resilience, equity, and sustainability. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential for transformation by facilitating predictive analytics, precision agriculture techniques, and supply chain optimisation initiatives. However, achieving meaningful, sustainable outcomes with AI involves more than just adopting new technologies; it requires developing strategic capabilities that integrate sustainability into organisational structures and broader systems. This research explores how AI can be perceived as an essential tool in driving sustainable transformation efforts.<br>

This research investigates how AI enhances strategic capabilities that promote sustainability in agri-food supply chains. A sequential mixed-methods approach will be utilised across three studies. In Study I, a systematic review of literature and policies will be conducted to consolidate current knowledge and identify key AI-driven capabilities. Study II involves gathering stakeholder perceptions through semi-structured interviews with actors from upstream, midstream, and downstream segments of the supply chain to contextualise the framework. Finally, Study III aims to empirically validate the connections between AI adoption, strategic capabilities, and sustainability outcomes by employing covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) using an international survey sample (n ≈ 250).<br>

The expected contributions are threefold: firstly, a theoretical contribution that merges AI adoption with the capability-based perspectives on sustainability transformation; secondly, an empirical contribution by testing and validating these relationships within and beyond the Australian context; and thirdly, a practical contribution by offering policymakers and industry leaders actionable insights into strategically utilising AI to enhance resilience and competitiveness in the Australian agri-food system, with transferable lessons for global contexts.

<h2><strong>Research Design</strong></h2>
<p>
<strong>Study I - Mapping Knowledge: </strong>Systematic review of literature and policies to identify key AI-driven capabilities.<br>
<strong>Study II - Industry Insights: </strong>Semi-structured interviews with upstream, midstream, and downstream stakeholders to contextualise the framework.<br>
<strong>Study III - Validation: </strong>Empirical testing of AI adoption, strategic capabilities, and sustainability outcomes using CB-SEM (n ≈ 250).<br>
</p>
<h2><strong>What I’m Working On</strong></h2>
<p>I’m currently midway through my first study, conducting a focused literature review and preparing for in-depth industry interviews. My aim is to identify which AI capabilities genuinely drive sustainable value in agri-food supply chains, and how organisations can leverage them strategically to enhance resilience, competitiveness, and environmental performance. By bridging academic insights with real-world perspectives, I’m exploring actionable ways to transform technology from a digital tool into a strategic capability for long-term sustainability.</p>
<h2><strong>Why This Study?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Industry</strong><br>
Agri-food firms are investing heavily in AI but still lack the strategic capabilities needed to turn digital tools into measurable sustainability performance. This study provides an evidence-based capability framework that helps organisations prioritise the AI investments that actually improve resilience, reduce waste, and enhance environmental outcomes.
<p><strong>Policy</strong><br>
Sustainability policy is advancing faster than industry capacity to respond. This research offers policymakers clarity on the capability gaps preventing effective AI-enabled transformation, supporting more targeted policy interventions and capacity-building strategies across the agri-food sector.
<p><strong>Academic</strong><br>
Despite rapid growth in AI research, there is no integrated model explaining how AI capabilities translate into sustainability outcomes in complex supply chains. This study fills that gap by linking AI capability theory, strategic management, and sustainability research through a validated, multi-level framework, advancing both theory and empirical understanding.
