							<p>This Power BI dashboard presents a high-level Strategic Procurement Portfolio analysis, effectively using repurposed data to visualize key supplier metrics. The core narrative is the breakdown of the 10,015 total active suppliers into Strategic (Tier 1) vs. Standard (Tier 2) categories, which shows a near 50/50 split (5,039 Tier 1 vs. 4,976 Tier 2), resulting in an excellent 1.01 On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate suggesting a highly efficient supply base. The risk perspective is covered by the Tier 1/2 Supplier Count by Geographic Region, which highlights a significant concentration of suppliers in California (CA) and Texas (TX), underscoring potential geographic concentration risk.<br>
This regional risk is further tied to financial impact by the Top 5 Supplier Spend by Headquarter State, confirming that California and Texas also account for the largest proportion of annual spend, making those regions critical for supply chain stability. The Contract Status Distribution provides an actionable view of the supplier portfolio's maturity, indicating that the vast majority of suppliers (7.2K) are currently in the key U4 or primary contract status, while a smaller group (1.8K) are in the U1 category, potentially representing contracts due for renewal.<br>
